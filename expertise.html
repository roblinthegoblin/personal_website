				<p> I am a Techno-Economic Analyst working within offshore renewable energy. My day to day job involves assessing the economic viability of different renewable energy technologies that are deployed in the ocean, namely: </p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Offshore wind (fixed and floating)</li>
					<li>Tidal stream</li>
					<li>Wave energy</li>
				</ul>
			    </p>
				<p>I have over eight years of experience working in this sector. I specialise in the following areas:</p>

						<h3>Techno-economic assessment</h3>
						<p>While I come from a scientific background, my career has been shaped by my great interest in economics and finance. Since 2014 I have specialised in techno-economic assessment of offshore renewable energy. This involves designing models and tools to calculate costs and energy yield.</p>
						<p>My skill set covers analysis methods such as levelised cost of energy, discounted cash flow, cost and yield assessment and technology appraisal. I frequently combine my love for programming and GIS (more details on these below) with this techno-economic expertise to develop bespoke models in Python and Microsoft Excel. These have been used to advise multinational, world leading companies on their renewable energy investment strategies, contributing towards a greener tomorrow. </p>

						<h3>Software development and coding</h3>
						<p>I started learning the Python language in 2014, as part of my Engineering Doctorate. I have developed object orientated models to evaluate cost of energy of wave energy farms (for my EngD) and offshore wind farms (at my previous employer, BVG Associates).</p>
						<p>Programming is a growing passion of mine. During my career I have also developed Python modules for GIS analysis, integration with Microsoft Excel workbooks, and am currently developing a number of webapps using the Flask Python package.</p>
						<p>I am also adept at Visual Basic (VBA) and have a working knowledge of SQL Server. I am also learning HTMl (so please excuse, or even better report, any issues you find with this website :D).</p>

						<h3>GIS</h3>
					<p>I started learning GIS towards the end of my EngD, in 2016, as I needed to create some maps to visualise the results from my research (more information can be found <a href="expertise/engd.html">here</a>.</p>
					<p>Over the years I improved my GIS knowledge, leading and delivering several GIS projects at my previous employer BVG Associates (where I led GIS activities).</p>
					<p>I continue to deliver and coordinate GIS work at my current employer, the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, where GIS remains one of my favourite pastimes.</p>
					<p>You can read more about my GIS experience and projects <a href="expertise/gis.html">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>Project management</h3>
						<p>I enjoy managing projects, communicating with clients and collaborating with my team to drive forward success. As my career progresses I am ever developing these skills, and take great satisfaction from completing high quality deliverables to time and budget.</p>
