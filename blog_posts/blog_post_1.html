							With only a few days of January left it might seem a bit pointless to start the Veganuary challenge now. But if not Veganuary then why not try Vegruary? Or Vegmarch (ok that pun isn't great)?
						</p>
						<p>
							Veganuary is a recent phenomenon. For those unaware it is a challenge to eat only Vegan food throughout the month of January. I learnt recently that Veganuary is actually the name of the non-profit organisation, registered in England and Wales and founded in 2014, who promote the challenge. 
						</p>
						<p>
							From their <a href="https://veganuary.com/">website</a>, Veganuary state their mission values as:
						</p>
							<blockquote style="white-space: pre-line"><p>Our vision is simple; we want a vegan world.

							A world without animal farms and slaughterhouses. A world where food production does not decimate forests, pollute rivers and oceans, exacerbate climate change and drive wild animal populations to extinction.

							Our mission is to inspire and support people to try vegan, drive corporate change, and create a global mass movement championing compassionate food choices with the aim of ending animal farming, protecting the planet, and improving human health.</p>
							</blockquote>
						<p>
							I was born and raised vegetarian but have made a conscious effort to move towards veganism for a few years and have been a vegan for about six months. While it might seem a daunting prospect, I think that it is an amazing thing to do and is arguably the most reasonable way that an individual can lower their personal emissions and live a more sustainable, lower carbon footprint lifestyle.
						</p>
						<p>In this blog post I want to summarise the benefits of trying out Veganuary and give some tips to those who are interested to learn more about the lifestyle. I have no affiliation with the Veganuary organisation, but thought that it would make an interesting topic.</p>

						<h2>Improving culinary skills</h2>
						<p>
							The main thing that I found when I transitioned into a vegan diet was how rapidly my culinary skills improved. I could not longer chuck cheese on everything to make it taste good; I had to learn how to season food and balance tastes properly.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my opinion, cooking is one of the best lifelong skills you can gain. It is fun, encourages creativity and is far healthier and cheaper then eating out regularly. Some tips I would give to those trying vegan cooking for Veganuary are the following:
						</p>
						
						<ol>
							<li><p><b>Taste, taste, taste</b><br>
								As you cook taste your food as you go along. Does it need something? Would X flavour work (for me it is usually ADD MORE CHILLI).</p></li>
							<li><p><b>Salt is your friend</b><br>
								If your dish is missing something then it could well be salt. Salt, as a flavour enhancer, is great at bringing out out the natural flavours of the dish. Of course too much is a bad thing for health, so be aware and taste as you are adding it.</p></li>
							<li><p><b>The five basic flavours</b><br>
								Ok so if salt isn't missing well what is? Well the other four basic flavours are sweet, sour, bitter and umami. A dash of acid can really lift a meal (think lemon juice or vinegar). Or some sweetness to help balance the meal (for example a small amount of sugar or maple syrup). We all have different taste buds and preferences, and I think this is largely instinctual, so the best way to develop this skill is by cooking more and experimenting. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I find that a lot of recipes understate the quantity of spices so I usually increase these when I cook (for example using tablespoons rather than teaspoons, or adding a few extra cloves of garlic). </p></li>		
							<li><p><b>Where to shop?</b><br>
								All of the major supermarkets cater extremely well for a vegan diet now, especially in January when they substantially increase their ranges for Veganuary. As you go through the month you will learn where to find things. For example I tend to shop at Aldi and Lidl which usually have some vegan pizzas but lack vegan cheeses (I promise this example is not representative of my typical diet...mostly).</p>
								<p>
								My sister and her partner are trying Veganuary and had the great idea to try a different supermarket each time they shop. I think that this is a great way to examine different options and see where caters best to your preferences.
								</p>
								<p>
									I find that the Asian supermarket is a great place to shop. In my local they have a great selection of staples (rice, pulses, legumes, nuts, seeds, spices) as well as interesting, less familiar ingredients for experimenting. You can also buy in bulk and get substantial savings. For example, recently I bought a 300g bag of crushed chillies from the Asian supermarket for £1.09, about 0.35p per 100g. In Aldi, at the time of writing, a small 29g jar of crushed chillies is 49p, or £1.69 per 100g (almost five times more expensive).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><p><b>But what to make?</b><br>
								Well, whatever you want. Pretty much anything you can think of there will be a vegan alternative. There have been vegan meat alternatives for years, but now cheese and milk substitutes are also commonplace. While they taste different to the conventional options, I find that when you are cooking with them they can be just as good and sometimes indistinguishable. 	
							</p>
							<p>
								While I do have my favourite meals that I make regularly (and will share in future blogs), a lot of my cooking involves buying an ingredient I rarely cook with and searching for "vegan X recipes" for nice sounding recipes. Recent examples have included a 
								<a href="https://www.riverford.co.uk/recipes/celeriac-curry-chard-and-rice">celeriac, coconut milk curry</a>
								(from searching for "vegan celeriac recipes") and 
								<a href="https://thepeskyvegan.com/recipes/vegan-haggis/">vegan "haggis"</a> 
								for Burns night. With the curry I made these 
								<a href="https://wendyfinn.com/vegan-naan-bread-recipe/">peshwari naans</a>, 
								which were very straightforward and mind-blowingly good.
							</p>
							<p>
								I find baking surprisingly easy. While there are some recipes very reliant on dairy, there are vegan recipes for all kinds of things (for example I made these very quick and easy 
								<a href="https://veganyumminess.com/vegan-apple-oatmeal-cookies/">cookies</a> 
								last week). You really don't need milk or eggs at all.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am a firm believer in following recipes, especially when starting out, as it is a good way to learn new skills and flavour combinations.
							</p>
							</li>
						</ol>

						<h2>Reduce your footprint</h2>
						<p>
							I work in renewable energy. For me climate change was the main motivation to cutting and eventually removing dairy from my diet. 
						</p>
						<p>
						It is well understood that the meat and dairy industry uses more resources and typically produces more CO2 than arable farming. 
						<a href="https://josephpoore.com/Science%20360%206392%20987%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript.pdf">A recent study</a>, examining almost 40,000 farms across the world, estimated that meat, aquaculture, eggs, and dairy use 83% of the worlds farmland and contribute about 56% of the emissions associated with food, but only provide 18% of our calories. Cows milk is typically attributed to higher CO2 emissions, water usage and land usage compared to plant-based alternatives, as the same study indicates.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/22/eu-farm-animals-produce-more-emissions-than-cars-and-vans-combined-greenpeace">In the EU </a>it has been estimated that livestock produced more CO2 than all of the cars in the bloc, when the feed is also taken into account. If everybody was vegan then CO2 emissions from food could be 
							<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/vegan_vs_flexitarian">49% lower</a> with 76% less land use. 
							<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/15/4110">Indeed</a>, about 30% of the arable crops that are grown go towards feeding animals, and animal agriculture has been estimated to need 6-17 times more land per unit of protein compared to soybeans (partly for the required feed). 
							<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263353807_Dietary_greenhouse_gas_emissions_of_meat-eaters_fish-eaters_vegetarians_and_vegans_in_the_UK">A study by the University of Oxford</a> estimated that a meat eating diet has about double the CO2 emissions compared to a vegan diet. The study concluded that:
						</p>

						<blockquote style="white-space: pre-line"><p>...reducing the intake of meat and other animal based products can make a valuable contribution to climate change mitigation. Other work has demonstrated other environmental and health benefits of a reduced meat diet. National governments that are considering an update of dietary recommendations in order to define a ‘healthy, sustainable diet’ must incorporate the recommendation to lower the consumption of animal-based products.</p>
						</blockquote>
		

						<h2>Animal welfare</h2>
						<p>
							We live in a supply and demand economy. If there is a demand for animal products then there will be companies to fill the consumer need. Therefore the argument of "well the animals are dead anyway" is a weak one; as individuals we do have power to change the discourse and the direction of travel with our purchasing power. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Many people would profess to be animal lovers. Dogs are cute. Cats are cute (especially my neighbour's ginger kitten that successfully infiltrated my house last week). But so are baby cows and pigs, among other farmyard animals. A person who consumes meat and dairy could certainly identify as pet lover, but as an animal lover? Did you know that 
							<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/search-for-a-kinder-way-of-killing-pigs-w8jptrj8f#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20the,The%20rest%20are%20electrically%20stunned."> over half of the 9,000,000 pigs </a>
							slaughtered in the UK each year are killed in gas chambers?
							Or that 
							<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51301915">7,000,000,000 male chicks</a> 
							are macerated at birth across the world (typically ground up in shredding machines or again, gas chambers) as their meat is not preferred and they are unable to lay eggs.
						</p>

						<p>
							"But this doesn't apply to the food I consume" some might be thinking. "I only buy organic, locally produced meat from [insert family member's] farm". Well despite this some 
							<a href="https://civileats.com/2017/09/05/factory-farming-is-sweeping-the-uk/">95% of the chickens </a> reared in the UK are grown indoors in industrial warehouses, and 
							<a href="https://www.ciwf.org.uk/factory-farm-map/">73% of all farm animals</a>. Can you really say with certainty that you avoid all of this? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02GNr5DnPCk" target="_blank">Well assuming that humane slaughter is possible at all.</a>
						</p>				
						<p>
							There are several films that show the typical conditions of farms and slaughter houses; two examples are Dominion and Earthlings (the latter focussed on the UK). 
							<a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html#:~:text=Cognitive%20dissonance%20refers%20to%20a,the%20discomfort%20and%20restore%20balance.">Cognitive dissonance</a> 
							is a well understood and very real phenomenon: it makes us uncomfortable to be introduced to concepts that raise inconsistencies in our moral codes. Becoming vegan is a commitment, and a lifestyle that requires some consideration. But Veganuary is a great way to reduce your animal consumption. If, at the start of the year, somebody offered you a way to reduce the number of animals your diet harmed over the year by 1/12 (i.e. one month) would you take it?  	
						</p>
						<p>
							One final thought (before I get too preachy, if it isn't too late...): Is it really worth ending the life of a sentient being, with it's own complexities, thoughts, emotions, for a single meal, which you will likely forget about after a few days. What did you have for lunch, say, two weeks ago, or, on a random date like January the 3rd 2021? I know I can't remember.
						</p>

						<h2>A distraction from current events</h2>
						<p>
							Obviously there is a lot going on in the world at the moment. There is a lot of merit in finding hobbies and activities to unlock (and distract!) the mind from current events. Taking on a challenge like Veganuary will help to alleviate boredom and encourage learning and creative thinking (for example by prompting the question: how can I adapt my favourite recipes to remove the meat and dairy?).
						</p>

						<h2>For the challenge</h2>
						<p>
							Most of us appreciate some form of challenge in our lives, to help us to adapt and improve over time. Try and succeeding in something can give a lot of satisfaction and positivity. It helps motivate us towards other goals that we might have in our lives. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I don't expect Veganuary would be too difficult for most people due to the huge and growing amount of vegan options that can be found in every supermarket, but the sense of accomplishment that will come with it will be significant. It will provide a good start to the year, a step in the right direction and a platform for other personal goals that you might have.
						</p>

						<h2>Conclusions</h2>
						<p>
							To conclude: I think that Veganuary offers a great way for one to improve their cooking skills and repertoire, reduce their CO2 emissions and their impact on the environment and as a fun challenge to alleviate lockdown boredom. As humans it is good for us to learn, to challenge our beliefs and to try new things, to grow as individuals. Give it a go, and let me know how you get on!
