With only XX days of January left it might seem a bit pointless to start the Veganuary challenge now. Veganuary is a recent phenomenon. For those unaware it is a challenge to eat only Vegan food throughout the month of January. Veganuary is actually the name of the non-profit organisation, registered in England and Wales, who promote the challenge. From their website[link], Veganuary state their mission values as:

"Our vision is simple; we want a vegan world.

A world without animal farms and slaughterhouses. A world where food production does not decimate forests, pollute rivers and oceans, exacerbate climate change and drive wild animal populations to extinction.

Our mission is to inspire and support people to try vegan, drive corporate change, and create a global mass movement championing compassionate food choices with the aim of ending animal farming, protecting the planet, and improving human health."
